# Code-Project
Hi,
I am making this website project to show my work to code Louisville .I have created my resume page and linked to My online Restaurant site.
This front end development is responsive to different devices.
This project includes lots of CSS selectors in style.CSS file.
This project includes JavaScript which is in app.js file.
This website project has comments noting major portions.
Also this project is on my GitHub account in its "code-lou" repository.
Thanks
Vandana Saxena
